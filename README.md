### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ my name is Felix Navas

[Linkedin profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/felix-morillas-navas-323107153)

My Plan for 2020 finally for private purposes to use Github again and 
to write all milestones into my profile and to contribute again in Github.

Technical goals:
    - Python 3.8
    - Google Colab jupyter notebooks
    - find useful Github plugins for this kind of work

1. FastAI
    - book "deep learning for coders with fastai and pytorch"
    - documentation
2. Pytorch
    - book "Deep Learning with PyTorch-Manning Publications (2020)"
    - deeplizard
    - documentation
3. [Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/)
    - book "getting things done with pytorch"
    - documentation

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on FastAI tutorial to include everything in colab notebooks
